# Team Data Dynamos - Pragyan 25 Hackathon

## Project: AI-Powered Predictive Safety System with AR Guidance

### Overview
Our project integrates **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Augmented Reality (AR)** to create a cutting-edge safety system designed for high-risk industrial sectors like construction, mining, and manufacturing. By combining AI's predictive capabilities with AR's immersive guidance, this solution proactively identifies hazards and ensures real-time risk mitigation to protect workers and improve operational safety.

### Key Features

1. **AI-Driven Hazard Detection**
   - Machine learning models analyze historical and real-time data to predict potential risks such as equipment malfunctions or unsafe behaviors.
   - Integration with IoT devices for environmental and equipment monitoring.

2. **AR-Powered Real-Time Guidance**
   - AR devices overlay critical safety information, such as hazardous zones and step-by-step protocols, onto workers' field of vision.
   - Immersive alerts and instructions ensure quick and informed decision-making.

3. **Wearable Technology Integration**
   - Real-time monitoring of workers' vital signs using wearable devices.
   - AI detects signs of fatigue or distress and triggers timely interventions.

4. **Adaptive Safety Protocols**
   - Dynamic adjustments to safety guidelines based on live data insights.
   - Ensures compliance with safety standards and minimizes human error.
